[Buffers](https://github.com/SeyedMahmoudian/compilers/blob/master/ass01/ass01/Buffer.c) are often used when developing compilers because of their efficiency.This is an impletement [buffer](https://github.com/SeyedMahmoudian/compilers/blob/master/ass01/ass01/Buffer.c) that can operate in three different mode:
1. Fixed size 
2. Additive self-incrementing 
3. Multuplicative self-incrementing 

The [buffer](https://github.com/SeyedMahmoudian/compilers/blob/master/ass01/ass01/Buffer.c) implementation is base on two associated data structes: 
* Buffer Descriptor
* Array of characters

Both structure are created on demand at run time. 

The Buffer Descriptor or Buffer Handle suggest the purpose of this [buffer](https://github.com/SeyedMahmoudian/compilers/blob/master/ass01/ass01/Buffer.c) control data structure containts all the necessary information about the array of characters.
